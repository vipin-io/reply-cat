## Why ReplyCat?

Most email assistants either:
- Auto-blast replies (like **LAMBDA**) with little control, or
- Require training on your inbox (like **Panza**), slowing you down.

** ReplyCat is different:**
-  Instant setup—no training or archive scraping
-  One-click TL;DR + 3 AI reply options
-  100% local inference using Ollama (Phi-3 / Zephyr)
-  Gmail tokens stored in OS keychain (never touch frontend)
-  Works via a browser extension calling your local headless app

## What Users Actually Want (from Reddit)

> “I feel that is the thing I primarily need rather than AI-generated emails.”  
→ ReplyCat starts with TL;DR, not blind drafts.

> “Does it learn which emails are really important?”  
→ You stay in control. We don’t overstep.

> “I totally get the privacy concern—it’s a big deal…”  
→ ReplyCat runs **entirely on-device**. No cloud APIs. No telemetry.
