## Why ReplyCat?

Most email assistants either:
- Auto-blast replies (like **LAMBDA**) with little control, or
- Require training on your inbox (like **Panza**), slowing you down.

** ReplyCat is different:**
-  Instant setup‚Äîno training or archive scraping
-  One-click TL;DR + 3 AI reply options
-  100% local inference using Ollama (Phi-3 / Zephyr)
-  Gmail tokens stored in OS keychain (never touch frontend)
-  Works via a browser extension calling your local headless app

‚Üí You stay in control. We don‚Äôt overstep.
